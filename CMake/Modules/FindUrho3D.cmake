# Find Urho3D include directories and libraries in the Urho3D SDK installation or build tree
# This module should be able to find Urho3D automatically when the SDK is installed in a system-wide default location
# If the SDK installation location is non-default or the Urho3D library is not installed at all (i.e. still in its build tree) then
#   use URHO3D_HOME environment variable or build option to specify the location of the non-default SDK installation or build tree
# When setting URHO3D_HOME variable, it should be set to a parent directory containing both the "include" and "lib" subdirectories
#   e.g. set URHO3D_HOME=/home/john/usr/local, if the SDK is installed using DESTDIR=/home/john and CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
