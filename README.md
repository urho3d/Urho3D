This master branch is constantly being "merged" from upstream urho3D/Urho3D master branch. You are encouraged to clone from upstream repository instead of this fork.
The purpose of this fork is to merge upstream with my personal topic branches (that are deemed not-worthy or not-stable yet for merging into upstream directly) and to perform CI build using Ubuntu Linux environment on Travis-CI.org. See master.OSX-CI branch for CI build result using OS X environment.
